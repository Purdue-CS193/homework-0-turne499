## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.



# Carson Turner's First CS 193 Homework
My favorite things about CS 193:
1. teachers seem to care a lot about their students
2. the class will assist me in other CS courses such as CS 180 and CS 176
3. the students in the class seem like hard workers and relatively social people
4. many students in this class major in Data Science, which is also my major
5. the class seems very engaging and not super stressful

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
